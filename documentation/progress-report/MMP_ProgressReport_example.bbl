 \begin{quotation}\noindent This paper explores and defines the discpline of
  phenomics from the perspective of neuroscience, medicine, and in relation to
  the human genonome. It provides a useful overview of the subject, whilst
  going into detail of its applications within areas not touched upon in this
  project. \end{quotation}

 \begin{quotation}\noindent This paper explores image analysis as a
  nondestructive method for studying plant growth in Arabidopsis, and presents
  ``Rosette Tracker", which is an open source tool designed to work on both
  high-throughout and small-scale and low-tech phenomic projects. It looks at
  reasons for such methods, and outlines clear procedures of a method for plant
  detection through the use of hue modelling, segmentation, and connected
  component detection. \end{quotation}
